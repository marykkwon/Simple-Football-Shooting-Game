💻 A short introduction of your design and implementation:

We designed a simple football shooting game.

+ First, draw big picture such as grass ground, sky...

+ Then, figure out the transformation for each object; for instance: the goalkeeper should move back and forth in a range

+ Add the hit button, figure out the transformation for the ball when clicking it.

+ Next, Collision Detection. Find center of goalkeeper and ball, calculate the distance. 
If distance<= number, trigger hit. If hit the goalkeeper, fail the game. Otherwise, the player wins.

+ Last, figure out how to stop the animation when it fails or wins the game.

✅ Advanced features:

+ Collision Detection
